                  the website “abysshookah.com” does not intend to violate the
                  rights of third parties, not even negligent. However, should
                  there be problems of any kind, we would like to ask you to
                  contact us immediately. If you suspect that this website
                  violates any of your intellectual property rights, please
                  notify us immediately by email so that remedial action can be
                  taken quickly. Please note: The more time-consuming
                  intervention of a lawyer for the fee-based warning for the
                  service provider does not correspond to his real or presumed
                  will. Establishing contact makes sense on both sides to avoid
                  unnecessary litigation and unnecessary costs. We will
                  immediately have your objection examined and immediately stop
                  it if warranted. Without prior contact, we will reject the
                  cost note of your legal efforts and warning in the sense of a
                  duty of mitigation on your part as unfounded.
