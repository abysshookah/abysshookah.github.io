                  Our website uses, in particular, tools from companies based in

                  country within the meaning of EU data protection law. US
                  companies are required to release personal data to security
                  authorities without you as the data subject being able to take
                  legal action against this. The possibility cannot therefore be

                  process, evaluate and permanently store your data on US
                  servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence over

                  to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in

                  For security reasons and to protect the transmission of
                  confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you
                  submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either
                  an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an
                  encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of
                  the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by
                  the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
                  <br />
                  If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit
                  to us cannot be read by third parties.

                  If you are under an obligation to share your payment
                  information (e.g. account number if you give us the authority
                  to debit your bank account) with us after you have entered

                  required to process payments.
                  <br />
                  Payment transactions using common modes of paying
                  (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are processed
                  exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can
                  recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the
                  address line of the browser switches from “http://” to
                  “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the
                  browser line.
                  <br />
                  If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will
                  not be able to read the payment information you share with us.

                  Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as
                  “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that do not cause any
                  damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for
                  the duration of a session (session cookies) or they are
                  permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies).
                  Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate
                  your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device
                  until you actively delete them or they are automatically
                  eradicated by your web browser.
                  <br />
                  In some cases, it is possible that third-party cookies are
                  stored on your device once you enter our site (third-party
                  cookies). These cookies enable you or us to take advantage of

                  Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are

                  obtained (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR); this consent may be

                  You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner

                  In the event that third-party cookies are used or if cookies

                  Communication via WhatsApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                  For communication with our customers and other third parties,
                  one of the services we use is the instant messaging service
                  WhatsApp. The provider is WhatsApp Ireland Limited, 4 Grand
                  Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
                  <br />
                  The communication is encrypted end-to-end (peer-to-peer),
                  which prevents WhatsApp or other third parties from gaining
                  access to the communication content. However, WhatsApp does
                  gain access to metadata created during the communication
                  process (for example, sender, recipient, and time). We would
                  also like to point out that WhatsApp has stated that it shares
                  personal data of its users with its U.S.-based parent company
                  Facebook. Further details on data processing can be found in
                  the WhatsApp privacy policy at:

                  </a>

                  <br />
                  The use of WhatsApp is based on our legitimate interest in
                  communicating as quickly and effectively as possible with
                  customers, interested parties and other business and
                  contractual partners (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). If a corresponding
                  consent has been requested, data processing is carried out
                  exclusively on the basis of the consent; this consent may be
                  revoked at any time with effect for the future.
                  <br />
                  The communication content exchanged between and on WhatsApp
                  remains with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your
                  consent to storage or the purpose for which the data is stored
                  ceases to apply (e.g. after your request has been processed).
                  Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods -
                  remain unaffected.
                  <br />
                  We use WhatsApp in the “WhatsApp Business” variant.
                  <br />

                  The website operator uses Google Ads. Google Ads is an online
                  promotional program of Google Ireland Limited (“Google”),
                  Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
                  <br />
                  Google Ads enables us to display ads in the Google search
                  engine or on third-party websites, if the user enters certain
                  search terms into Google (keyword targeting). It is also
                  possible to place targeted ads based on the user data Google
                  has in its possession (e.g. location data and interests;
                  target group targeting). As the website operator, we can
                  analyze these data quantitatively, for instance by analyzing
                  which search terms resulted in the display of our ads and how
                  many ads led to respective clicks.
                  <br />
                  The use of Google Ads is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. et seq.
                  GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
                  marketing the operator’s services and products as effectively

                  <br />
                  Moreover, it is possible to link the advertising target groups
                  generated with Google Remarketing to device encompassing

                  interest-based customized advertising messages, depending on
                  your prior usage and browsing patterns on a device (e.g. cell

                  With the assistance of Google Conversion Tracking we are in a
                  position to recognize whether the user has completed certain

                  Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2,

                  will be transferred to the USA and other third-party countries
                  too.
                  <br />
                  This tool allows the tracking of page visitors after they have
                  been linked to the website of the provider after clicking on a

                  For us as the operators of this website, the collected data is

                  conclusions as to the identity of users. However, Facebook
                  archives the information and processes it, so that it is
                  possible to make a connection to the respective user profile
                  and Facebook is in a position to use the data for its own

                <p>
                  We offer website visitors the opportunity to submit job
                  applications to us (e.g. via e-mail, via postal services on by
                  submitting the online job application form). Below, we will
                  brief you on the scope, purpose and use of the personal data
                  collected from you in conjunction with the application
                  process. We assure you that the collection, processing and use
                  of your data will occur in compliance with the applicable data
                  privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and that
                  your data will always be treated as strictly confidential.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Scope and purpose of the collection of data
                </h3>
                <p>
                  If you submit a job application to us, we will process any
                  affiliated personal data (e.g. contact and communications
                  data, application documents, notes taken during job
                  interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a decision
                  concerning the establishment or an employment relationship.
                  The legal grounds for the aforementioned are § 26 New GDPR
                  according to German Law (Negotiation of an Employment
                  Relationship), Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR (General Contract
                  Negotiations) and – provided you have given us your consent –
                  Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR. You may revoke any consent given
                  at any time. Within our company, your personal data will only
                  be shared with individuals who are involved in the processing
                  of your job application.
                  <br />
                  If your job application should result in your recruitment, the
                  data you have submitted will be archived on the grounds of §
                  26 New GDPR and Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR for the purpose of
                  implementing the employment relationship in our data
                  processing system.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Data Archiving Period
                </h3>
                <p>
                  If we are unable to make you a job offer or you reject a job
                  offer or withdraw your application, we reserve the right to
                  retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our
                  legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) for up to 6
                  months from the end of the application procedure (rejection or
                  withdrawal of the application). Afterwards the data will be
                  deleted, and the physical application documents will be
                  destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the
                  event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data will
                  be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g. due
                  to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only
                  take place when the purpose for further storage no longer
                  applies.
                  <br />
                  Longer storage may also take place if you have given your
                  agreement (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or if statutory data
                  retention requirements preclude the deletion.
                  <br />
                  Admission to the applicant pool
                  <br />
                  If we do not make you a job offer, you may be able to join our
                  applicant pool. In case of admission, all documents and
                  information from the application will be transferred to the
                  applicant pool in order to contact you in case of suitable
                  vacancies.
                  <br />
                  Admission to the applicant pool is based exclusively on your
                  express agreement (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). The submission
                  agreement is voluntary and has no relation to the ongoing
                  application procedure. The affected person can revoke his
                  agreement at any time. In this case, the data from the
                  applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted, provided there are
                  no legal reasons for storage.
                  <br />
                  The data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted
                  no later than two years after consent has been granted.
